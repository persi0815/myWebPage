Hi! I'm yang jiwon, a second year Software student from Korea Aerospace University. 
I like doing personal projects, which you will find in the portfolio page of this website. 
My hobby is reading books and writing stories about me. 

Nowadays i am reading a book 'one-thing'. This book tell us to concentrate in one thing to be the best. I want to be a developer who works to find who I am, regardless of time and place.

Let's cheer up until we all become stars in the universe! Have a good day~
