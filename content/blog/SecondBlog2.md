For a long time this website has had a couple of links to contact me, but those days are over.

Now I have a brand new Hugo website with a custom written theme complete with

- A homepage with more social links, and description of my skills
- An about page with description of who I am
- A portfolio page to showcase all my projects
- A blog

### Why Hugo?

The first question is why a _site builder_? I'm competent at web development, why not just write it all myself? The markdown processing makes it much easier to just write words, not having to think about the formatting, and if I'm going to blog often, then I'll need that.
